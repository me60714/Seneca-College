      <h2 id="history">History</h2>
      <p>
        Domestic pigs are made by humans domesticating wild boars. Pig bones have been unearthed at
        many sites such as Çayönü in southeastern Turkey, the Jiahu site, and the Cishan site in
        China about 9000 years ago. They have obvious characteristics of domestic pigs, which shows
        that they have been domesticated. It's been a while. Domestic pigs all over the world are
        genetically more similar to native wild boars and are more distantly related to families in
        other regions. Therefore, it may be "multi-center independent domestication", that is, the
        civilizations of various regions in ancient times independently domesticated wild boars
        around them and derived many subspecies at the same time. The majority of domestic pigs in
        the world today contain blood from European or East Asian domestic pigs. European domestic
        pigs and Asian domestic pigs originated from Asian wild boars and European wild boars
        respectively, that is, modern domestic pigs have two maternal origins. Traditional domestic
        pigs in China are black, but they have a high-fat rate and are no longer common.

      <h2 id="rnb">Reproduction and Breeds</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <i
          >The breeding of domestic pigs is mainly carried out through natural mating and artificial
          insemination.</i

      <h3>Breeds of domestic pigs</h3>
      <p>
        The domestication of pigs is generally considered to be the domestication of local wild
        boars in different parts of the world. After thousands of years of crossbreeding, there are
        many varieties of pigs. In the 18th century, Europeans introduced Chinese pig strains to
        Europe and bred with the domesticated descendants of local wild boars to cultivate modern
        pigs with high meat exchange rates and become the world's mainstream pig breeds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, there are more than 400 pig breeds worldwide. Among them, mainland China has 64
        local pig breeds, which is the first in all countries.
      </p>

      <h3>Pig production</h3>
      <p>
        With the current development of modern agriculture, current pig production is moving in the
        direction of intensive and mechanized development. The place where pigs are raised on
        traditional family farms is called pigpen; in modern times, more and more pigs are raised in
        specialized pig farms.
      </p>

      <h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        Humans raise domestic pigs mainly for edible pork. Other foods from pigs include sausages,
        ham, bacon, bacon, pig skin, etc. Besides, pig liver, pig intestine, and pig blood are also
        used as food. Globally, pigs are the most commonly slaughtered animals after chickens and
        ducks. However, Judaism and Islam believe that pigs are unclean to humans, so pork is
        forbidden in their culture.

        Being food is not the only value of pigs. In the past, people used pigs to find and dig
        truffles. The reason is that both natural truffles and artificially planted truffles grow
        underground, and it is not easy to collect them. Moreover, the smell of truffles is similar
        to androstenol which induces sexual impulse of sows, so sows are most sensitive to truffles.
        So sows are natural truffle hunters. Moreover, sows also like truffles, they often eat the
        truffles they find directly, which is not easy to be controlled by hunters. Besides, when
        pigs use their noses to arch the ground, they will destroy the mycelium of truffles. It led
        to a decline in truffle production. Therefore, people became using dogs instead of pigs to
        find truffles. After 1985, the Italian government also banned the use of pigs to unearth
        truffles.
