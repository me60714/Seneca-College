1. What you have learned in completing this workshop

In this workshop, I practiced how to code C language via Visual Studio, and become familiar with it gradually. Basically, I can code, edit and execute a simple and little program by myself now. Besides, I learned how to log in and transfer files to my Matrix account.

2. Briefly describe what SSH is and how you used it in this workshop

SSH(Secured Socket Shell) can let us connect to our Matrix account in a safe way. In this workshop, I use Microsoft Command Prompt to interact with Seneca's Linux server. By using specific commands, we can view and edit the file or the menu, and so on.

3. Briefly describe what SFTP is and how you used it in this workshop

SFTP(Secured File Transfer Protocol) is a kind of tool to transfer files in a safe way. We use WinSCP to transfer our assignments to the school's server safely and easily.
